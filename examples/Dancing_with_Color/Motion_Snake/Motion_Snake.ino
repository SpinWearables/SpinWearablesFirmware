// The setup function should also seem familiar.
// As a reminder, the `setup` function is run once when
// the SpinWheel turns on. Also, `SpinWheel.begin()`
// prepares the LED to accept new colors.

// and takes its current rotation data.

// Use an **if statement** to check to see if the rotation is
// large enough. If the rotation is large enough, then 
// we will create a snake-like pattern on the device
// where the motion of the snake is based on the motion 
// of the device.  We add 20 to have the snake spin
// quickly. You can adjust this number
// to change the speed at which the snake rotates.
// Here we use (0,255,0) to make the 
// snake green, but you can use any color you like.
