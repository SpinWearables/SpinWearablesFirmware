/// # Dancing with Color: Changing color in response to a 3D rotation. 
///
/// In this example, we will build off of previous examples
/// in order to code the color LEDs of the SpinWheel in order 
/// to respond to a 3D rotation. For more information and 
/// other examples, refer to the [dancing companion page](https://spinwearables.com/dancing/).
//

// These include statements should look familiar!
// As a reminder, they allow the program to access
// coding tools for the SpinWheel.
#include "SpinWearables.h"
using namespace SpinWearables;

// The setup function should also seem familiar.
// As a reminder, the `setup` function is run once when
// the SpinWheel turns on. Also, `SpinWheel.begin()`
// prepares the LED to accept new colors.
void setup() {
  SpinWheel.begin();
}

// Now, we will need to initialize three variables, 
// for the red, green, and blue LED of each big 
// LED. These variables will hold information
// telling the SpinWheel whether or not to 
// display these colors.  
int red = 0;
int green = 0;
int blue = 0;

// Instructions in a loop function are repeated over and over again,
// in other words, "in a loop".
void loop() {

// The `readIMU` function checks if the sensor is ready
// and takes its current rotation data.
  SpinWheel.readIMU();

// Set the colors to zero. Below we will measure rotations
// and change the values away from zero if necessary. 
  red = 0;
  green = 0;
  blue = 0;

// Here we will also use if statements. 
// In this case if the rotation in the 
// **x direction** is large, then we will change 
// the value of the `red` variable. Later, this
// will be used to turn red LED of **each** 
// big LED on. 
  if (abs(SpinWheel.gx) > 1) {
    red = 255;
  }

// Similarly, if the rotation in the	
// **y	direction** is large, then we will
// change the value of the `green` variable.
// Later this will be use to turn the
// green LED of **each** big LED on.
  if (abs(SpinWheel.gy) > 1) {
    green = 255;
  }

// Also, if the rotation in the **z-direction**
// is large, then  we will change the value of the
// `blue` variable. Later this will be used to turn 
// the blue LED of **each** big LED on. 
  if (abs(SpinWheel.gz) > 1)  {
    blue = 255;
  }

// Here, we will use the `setLargeLEDsUniform` and 
// `setSmallLEDsUniform` function to tell the  
// SpinWheel what color to display. 
  SpinWheel.setLargeLEDsUniform(red, green, blue);
  SpinWheel.setSmallLEDsUniform(red, green, blue);

  SpinWheel.drawFrame();
 }
